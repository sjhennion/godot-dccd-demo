# Godot Subaru DCCD Demo

I'm currently working on learning Zoo's Design Studio and KittyCAD Language by modeling a Subaru WRX STi DCCD.  You can find that specific work [over here](https://github.com/sjhennion/kcl_subaru_dccd).  

This repo is for the Godot Demo I'm building to present that work.  

You can run the latest version of the demo [right here in the browser](https://sjhennion.github.io/godot-dccd-demo/)

I'm using [godot-ci](https://github.com/abarichello/godot-ci) to deploy my demo to github
